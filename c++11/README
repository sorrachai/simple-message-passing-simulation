Please run 'make' to compile the program.

Set up parameter file first. See example in the given file 'parameters.in.linux'.

To run the program:
	
    ./hvc -p=<paramter file> -o=<output file name> -m=<mode 1 or 2>
	
  Mode 1:
 /*
  * Main simulation: run random unicast model for a long time 
  * , e.g., 'run_up_to' = 100000, then measure the average HVC size 
  * for 'absolute_time' between 'epsilon' and 'run_up_to'. 
  * Repeat this run for each value of 'epsilon' up to 'run_up_to' 
  */
  
  Mode 2:
  /*
  * Constrained time ('epsilon' < infinity) vs. unconstrained time model ('epsilon' * -> infinity):
  * run random unicast model while measuring the average HVC size 
  * for each 'absolute_time' given 'epsilon'. 
  */
 
 In mode 2: Matrix_<output file name> is also produced. This file list the current hvc size for each row. This can be used to plot in box-plot in MATLAB.
 
 To plot the result:
    Run in MATLAB or OCTAVE or your favorite plot program
